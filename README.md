Features & To-Do:
(marked with * are important, importance directly proportional to number of stars)

- [x] working upload/download blob files
- [x] simple UI style
- [ ] host local PeerJS server [*]
- [ ] increase file upload limit [**]
- [ ] fix bugs, currently has more bugs than features (*proud*) [***]
- [ ] add support for text transfer [**]
- [ ] add copy peerID button [**]
- [ ] add QR code support for peerID [*]
- [ ] option to encrypt files
- [ ] convert back to original file format after sending (currently doesn't and files need to be manually renamed back to the format) [***]
- [ ] add longer peer connection duration (?), without timing out on tab left-focus
- [ ] try to support local network peer discover, not sure if possible with current setup though
- [ ] add input option for local-hosted peerJS server [*]
- [ ] add support to url-shorten with an algorithm, or perhaps change peerID length thru peerJS local server, not sure if possible
- [ ] make persistent URLs for each device, not refreshing every time - easier to find/search devices, once again, not sure if possible with current PeerJS setup
